1241	there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion . 	1
1242	its valuable message makes it a must-see for children and teenagers , and even more so for those callous adults who have become casually corrupt in their efforts to simply get through life . 	1
1243	so earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script . 	1
1244	grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length	1
1245	as the national media become more sedate and incurious , this country desperately needs a gadfly like moore . indeed , we need more like him . 	1
1246	certainly no biopic , nijinsky is short on facts , but long on expression . 	1
1247	welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst . 	1
1248	an ironic speculation on democracy in a culture unaccustomed to it . 	1
1249	curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary . 	1
1250	aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane . 	1
1251	even if you have no interest in the gang-infested , east-vs . -west coast rap wars , this modern mob music drama never fails to fascinate . 	1
1252	it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 	1
1253	the sentimental script has problems , but the actors pick up the slack . 	1
1254	davis has filled out his cast with appealing fresh faces . 	1
1255	one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 	1
1256	the wild thornberrys movie has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate . 	1
1257	a bright , inventive , thoroughly winning flight of revisionist fancy . 	1
1258	the behind the scenes series is more interesting than the resulting movie , but it's still worth taking a look . 	1
1259	yes , mibii is rote work and predictable , but with a philosophical visual coming right at the end that extravagantly redeems it . 	1
1260	the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain . 	1
1261	it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b . s . one another and put on a show in drag . 	1
1262	a splendid entertainment , young in spirit but accomplished in all aspects with the fullness of spirit and sense of ease that comes only with experience . 	1
1263	the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace . 	1
1264	there's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms isn't it . 	1
1265	armed with a rad '80s soundtrack and a winning cast ( including indie rocker liz phair ) , cherish is an ingenious low-budget thriller . 	1

1267	no , the dangerous lives of altar boys does not exist in a state of perfect grace . however , its sins are forgivably venial , because its virtues are palpably human . 	1
1268	the new version isn't just endless . it heightens the deeply conservative spirit of giuseppe tornatore's fable in a surprising new way . 	1
1269	this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces . 	1
1270	the paradiso's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film's final ( restored ) thirdï¿½emotionally belittle a cinema classic . sometimes shorter is better . 	1
1271	a film that loses sight of its own story . 	1
1272	be forewarned , if you're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards . 	1
1273	a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 	1
1274	let's face it , even vin's fake tats have more charisma than pierce brosnan . 	1
1275	the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor . 	1
1276	it's a weepy , nail-biting story line that's all too familiar , although abbass portrays her character with strong conviction and carries the film gracefully . 	1
1277	watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost . 	1
1278	scherfig , the writer-director , has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar . yes , soar . 	1
1279	 . . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying . 	1
1280	human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal . 	1
1281	boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy , kinky fun . 	1
1282	a succinct , intelligent and scintillating slice of cultural history . 	1
1283	an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product . 	1
1284	as i settled into my world war ii memories , i found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances . 	1
1285	broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically doomed . 	1
1286	it's a shame that pokemon 4ever's dialogue is so trite and flatly delivered because the tale itself presents serious ideas worthy of more poetic language . 	1
1287	i'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about . 	1
1288	every once in a while , a movie will come along that turns me into that annoying specimen of humanity that i usually dread encountering the most - the fanboy	1
1289	the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendlyï¿½ alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . 	1
1290	it winds up moving in many directions as it searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say . 	1
1291	jackson and co have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema . 	1
1292	as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming . 	1
1293	any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 	1
1294	slow and ponderous , but rohmer's drama builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion , sacrifice , and christian love in the face of political corruption . 	1
1295	what it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and b-grade stylishness . 	1
1296	the pianist is the film roman polanski may have been born to make . 	1
1297	the director , mark pellington , does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head . 	1
1298	for all its random chaos , divine secrets works because of the power of its convictions -- and its cast . 	1
1299	significant for the chilling moments when the children echo the very sentiments that continue to fuel the middle east conflict . 	1
1300	what lee does so marvelously compelling is present brown as a catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america . . . sketchy but nevertheless gripping portrait of jim brown , a celebrated wonder in the spotlight	1
1301	the camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm . 	1
1302	renner's performance as dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing . 	1
1303	not only does this musical documentary showcase a band that's at the top of its form . . . it also serves as indictment of the ridiculously shallow , pre-fab music industry in general . 	1
1304	chabrol ratchets up such a level of suspense -- and huppert gives such a mesmerizingly deadpan performance -- that merci pour le chocolat turns out to be as irresistible as a piece of dark chocolate . 	1
1305	apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it . 	1
1306	jaunty fun , with its celeb-strewn backdrop well used . 	1
1307	weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 	1
1308	watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . 	1
1309	if you're an extreme sports fan , this is probably a must own dvd . 	1
1310	will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly . 	1
1311	the movie's ripe , enrapturing beauty will tempt those willing to probe its inscrutable mysteries . 	1
1312	it's a celebration of self-confidence and a slap in the face of a society that cherises impossibly unnatural physical perfection . 	1
1313	all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility . 	1
1314	 . . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes . 	1
1315	the special effects and cgi , uneven in sorcerer's stone , are all spit-shine and shoe-polish in chamber of secrets . there isn't one hair out of place . 	1
1316	it all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time . 	1
1317	"""essentially """" fatal attraction """" remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . . """	1
1318	the low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love . 	1
1319	it's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period . 	1
1320	while general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of cuban music , they'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds . 	1
1321	every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least--annoying , isn't it ? 	1
1322	this is not an easy film . but it could be , by its art and heart , a necessary one . 	1
1323	the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness . 	1
1324	a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 	1
1325	though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting . 	1
1326	brosnan gives a portrayal as solid and as perfect as his outstanding performance as bond in die another day . 	1
1327	too clumsy in key moments . . . to make a big splash . 	1
1328	what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety . 	1
1329	hoffman's performance is authentic to the core of his being . 	1
1330	it further declares its director , zhang yang of shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future . 	1
1331	even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . 	1
1332	' . . . a great , participatory spectator sport . '	1
1333	there's plenty of footage here of some of the world's best djs at work , and it's impressive , even for someone uninterested in the genre . 	1
1334	as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling . 	1
1335	like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone . you leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends . 	1
1336	one-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation . . . . stylistically , the movie is a disaster . 	1
1337	hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty . 	1
1338	i've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama . 	1
1339	all the movie's narrative gymnastics can't disguise the fact that it's inauthentic at its core and that its story just isn't worth telling . 	1
1340	has enough wit , energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they're not interested . 	1
1341	glizty but formulaic and silly . . . cagney's 'top of the world' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel . 	1
1342	legendary irish writer brendan behan's memoir , borstal boy , has been given a loving screen transferral . 	1
1343	sensitive , insightful and beautifully rendered film . one of the best of the year . 	1
1344	it's burns' visuals , characters and his punchy dialogue , not his plot , that carry waydowntown . 	1
1345	payami is to be applauded for taking biting potshots at such volatile issues as iran's outmoded electoral process and women's status as second-class citizens . 	1
1346	in any case , i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995's forget paris . but even then , i'd recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes . 	1
1347	manages in two minutes what malcolm lee's cousin spike's bamboozled couldn't in over two hours . 	1
1348	a model of what films like this should be like . 	1
1349	this is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos . 	1
1350	it seems lawrence has reflected deeply upon his down periods . they've left him wiser without dulling the sharp edges of his humor . 	1
1351	chilling but uncommercial look into the mind of jeffrey dahmer , serial killer . 	1
1352	straightforward and old-fashioned in the best possible senses of both those words , possession is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it . 	1
1353	peter jackson has done the nearly impossible . he has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper . what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery	1
1354	a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late . 	1
1355	sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 	1
1356	this is the kind of subject matter that could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker , but ayres makes the right choices at every turn . 	1
1357	suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 . 	1
1358	zhuangzhuang creates delicate balance of style , text , and subtext that's so simple and precise that anything discordant would topple the balance , but against all odds , nothing does . 	1
1359	this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows . 	1
1360	self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable . 	1
1361	though it's become almost redundant to say so , major kudos go to leigh for actually casting people who look working-class . 	1
1362	schï¿½tte's dramatic snapshot of the artist three days before his death offers an interesting bit of speculation as to the issues brecht faced as his life drew to a close . 	1
1363	collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9/11 , an antique , in the end . as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness . 	1
1364	an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode . 	1
1365	another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie . 	1
1366	the script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors . 	1
1367	[shyamalan] continues to cut a swathe through mainstream hollywood , while retaining an integrity and refusing to compromise his vision . 	1
1368	 . . . a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life . 	1
1369	can't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ? try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes edward burns' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde . 	1
1370	there are moments in this account of the life of artist frida kahlo that are among cinema's finest this year . unfortunately , they're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of kahlo's life imaginable . 	1
1371	the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin couldn't keep my attention . 	1
1372	"""i walked away not really know who """" they """" were , what """" they """" looked like . why """" they """" were here and what """" they """" wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care . """	1
1373	it's hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you've seen the remake first . many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , [yet] are worthwhile . 	1
1374	if you're part of her targeted audience , you'll cheer . otherwise , maybe . 	1
1375	imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s . 	1
1376	the film brilliantly shines on all the characters , as the direction is intelligently accomplished . 	1
1377	it's refreshing to see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original . 	1
1378	ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . 	1
1379	it's got the brawn , but not the brains . 	1
1380	although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey	1
1381	upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that doesn't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them . 	1
1382	unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling . 	1
1383	what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance . 	1
1384	the talk-heavy film plays like one of robert altman's lesser works . 	1
1385	the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure . 	1
1386	bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer . 	1
1387	strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery . 	1
1388	swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell . 	1
1389	we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire . 	1
1390	it's simply delightful to watch an actor like michel serrault do his stuff . 	1
1391	"""while """" real women have curves """" suffers from an obvious and simplistic screenplay , it's a bright looking , well-acted charmer . """	1
1392	beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling . . . recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly . 	1
1393	as a singular character study , it's perfect . it's also the year's sweetest movie . 	1
1394	the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 	1
1395	the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view . 	1
1396	the process of figuring out the moment the movie re-imagines the battle of the bulge with a bare-chested guardsman and a pike is more than worth the price of admission . 	1
1397	add yet another hat to a talented head , clooney's a good director . 	1
1398	care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters . 	1
1399	 . . . a fairly disposable yet still entertaining b picture . 	1
1400	you may be captivated , as i was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why paul thomas anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear . 	1
1401	worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film . 	1
1402	a keep-'em-guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters . 	1
1403	an excellent date movie , because you and your date will likely be clinging on to each other within 10 minutes . 	1
1404	playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity . . . bisset is both convincing and radiant . 	1
1405	the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down . 	1
1406	a film that takes you inside the rhythms of its subject : you experience it as you watch . 	1
1407	it is really quite ironic then that the one guy putting out consistently good comedy is hollywood's most serious actor . 	1
1408	a special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of memento . . . 	1
1409	it's gripping entertainment in a popular vein -- the police procedural -- that nevertheless follows no preconceived formulas . 	1
1410	the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies . 	1
1411	because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 	1
1412	schefberg has the courage to make the story messily un-formulaic . 	1
1413	poignant and moving , a walk to remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter . 	1
1414	the warnings to resist temptation in this film . . . are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean . 	1
1415	martha is rich in contradictions , her tightly wound personality running counter to the sensual pleasure she offers others through her art . 	1
1416	it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable . 	1
1417	stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros . -- peter and bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with green's half-hearted movie career . 	1
1418	where as many films of this nature linger on the hard , the ugly , the blood , or just the stylistic ; empire focuses on the thinking , the love , and even the light-heartedness , as well as the violence . 	1
1419	this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie . 	1
1420	for the first time in several years , mr . allen has surpassed himself with the magic he's spun with the hollywood empress of ms . leoni's ellie . 	1
1421	spider-man is about growing strange hairs , getting a more mature body , and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units . 	1
1422	an earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool . 	1
1423	the film is probably worth seeing for the sheer spectacle of it all , for the sake of obtaining valuable information , and for finding more closure on a story that has always been missing several pieces . 	1
1424	laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl's dilemma . 	1
1425	trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens . 	1
1426	like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions . 	1
1427	the film is like sitting in a downtown cafï¿½ , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables . 	1
1428	a self-narrated , blatantly lop-sided , cocky , nonchalant , fascinating and juicily entertaining documentary . 	1
1429	for all its bile and incoherence , in praise of love is filled with haunting images and insights . godard may be a lion in winter , but the lion still roars . 	1
1430	hands down the year's most thought-provoking film . but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship . 	1
1431	casting its gaze on painting masterworks and thousands of jewel-encrusted , elaborately costumed extras , russian ark is like nothing you've ever seen . 	1
1432	while the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they're presented with a wry dark humor . 	1
1433	in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song . 	1
1434	if your taste runs to 'difficult' films you absolutely can't miss it . 	1
1435	boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 	1
1436	waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality . 	1
1437	as charming , humorous and heimisch as its nomadic subjects . 	1
1438	 . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 	1
1439	hoffman's unfettered performance beautifully captures wilson's sad , manic quality . 	1
1440	each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time . 	1
1441	maybe the title should have been confusions of a dangerous mind , though the confusion , in this case , can be pretty sublime . 	1
1442	what would have otherwise been a routine nostalgic coming-of-ager takes on a new , innovative form . 	1
1443	it's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and i think that's what i liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline . 	1
1444	10 minutes into the film you'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away . 	1
1445	 . . . plenty of warmth to go around , with music and laughter and the love of family . 	1

1666	for anyone who cares about the future of america , it's required viewing . 	1
1667	a movie that can't get sufficient distance from leroy's delusions to escape their maudlin influence . 	1
1668	despite a quieter middle section , involving aragorn's dreams of arwen , this is even better than the fellowship . there are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away . 	1

1672	another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues . 	1
1673	one of the film's most effective aspects is its tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret . 	1

1675	it's everything you don't go to the movies for . 	1

1684	a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie . 	1
1685	a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story . 	1
1686	a highly spirited , imaginative kid's movie that broaches neo-augustinian theology : is god stuck in heaven because he's afraid of his best-known creation ? 	1
1687	purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons . 	1
1688	 . it's a testament to the film's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries . there's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls . . . 	1

1692	abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . 	1
1693	empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it doesn't work as either . 	1
1694	making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror . 	1

1726	a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers . 	1

1732	does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ? 	1
1733	an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood . 	1
1734	though not as tightly focused or as well-performed as malkovich , human nature has its own absurdist flair . 	1
1735	for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout . 	1
1736	gangster no . 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults . 	1
1737	just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love . 	1
1738	as literary desecrations go , this makes for perfectly acceptable , occasionally very enjoyable children's entertainment . you'll forget about it by monday , though , and if they're old enough to have developed some taste , so will your kids . 	1
1739	the film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul's perspective . 	1
1740	[jaglom] creates an engaging insider's world of enthusiastically entertaining characters and absorbing situations . 	1
1741	it offers an important lesson about how a supposedly simple disagreement can get so far out of hand that lives are lost . 	1
1742	if [jaglom's] latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling , some of its repartee is still worth hearing . 	1
1743	both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter . 	1
1744	a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect . 	1
1745	it's fun , but the code-talk will fly right over everyone's head	1
1746	the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) . 	1
1747	there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see . 	1
1748	payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast . 	1
1749	 ( un cineasta ) para no entender del todo y para seguir esperando . 	1
1750	you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy's holes , and the scripters don't deserve any oscars . but the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment . 	1
1751	a beautiful , entertaining two hours . you get the idea , though , that kapur intended the film to be more than that . 	1
1752	in his latest effort , storytelling , solondz has finally made a movie that isn't just offensive -- it also happens to be good . 	1
1753	without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it's a bad , embarrassing movie . 	1
1754	it's [ricci's] best work yet , this girl-woman who sincerely believes she can thwart the world's misery with blind good will . 	1
1755	there is a real subject here , and it is handled with intelligence and care . 	1
1756	an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . 	1
1757	a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession ï¿½ one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom . 	1
1758	so unassuming and pure of heart , you can't help but warmly extend your arms and yell 'safe ! '	1
1759	this movie in a single breath goes to the very heart of the russian experience . 	1
1760	it's sobering , particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily , or soon . 	1
1761	oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel . 	1
1762	if you're willing to have fun with it , you won't feel cheated by the high infidelity of unfaithful . 	1
1763	unsung heroes of some of pop music's finest moments get to stand up and be counted in this documentary/concert/tribute . 	1
1764	it's unnerving , stimulating , likely to provoke anger and sorrow on both political sides -- and , above all , it's extremely funny . 	1
1765	the asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of jia with his family . 	1
1766	critics need a good laugh , too , and this too-extreme-for-tv rendition of the notorious mtv show delivers the outrageous , sickening , sidesplitting goods in steaming , visceral heaps . 	1
1767	there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 	1
1768	the film truly does rescue [the funk brothers] from motown's shadows . it's about time . 	1
1769	all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise . 	1
1770	in its chicken heart , crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises . 	1
1771	basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars . 	1
1772	the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) . 	1
1773	boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas . 	1
1774	the story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me . 	1
1775	meyjes's movie , like max rothman's future , does not work . 	1
1776	sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation . 	1
1777	it's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that . 	1
1778	most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river . 	1
1779	it's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash . 	1
1780	brings a rare , clinically specific sense of moral complexity and humanistic sympathy to the usual regimen of finger-pointing and exposure . 	1
1781	it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow . i can't . 	1
1782	it downplays the initial assault , referring to it only in fragmented flashbacks , while offering a cogent critique of ongoing attitudes about rape and its victims , particularly in japan . 	1
1783	mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor . 	1
1784	while broomfield's film doesn't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture , it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system . 	1
1785	merchant effectively translates naipaul's lively mix of characters from the page to screen . 	1
1786	this picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc's , despite a few whopping shootouts . 	1
1787	unlike trey parker , sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 	1
1788	viewers of barney's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it . 	1
1789	it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison . 	1
1790	cho , a clarion voice of reason in an unreasonable world , has a rare comic brilliance , incisiveness and relatability . 	1
1791	ultimately engages less for its story of actorly existential despair than for its boundary-hopping formal innovations and glimpse into another kind of chinese 'cultural revolution . '	1
1792	for a film that's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama isn't as funny as you'd hoped . for a film that's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama isn't as funny as you'd hoped . 	1
1793	surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy . 	1
1794	this isn't exactly profound cinema , but it's good-natured and sometimes quite funny . 	1
1795	a gripping little b-movie of more mood than substance , below nonetheless delivers on its modest promises . 	1
1796	the film's snags and stumblings are more than compensated for by its wryly subversive tone . 	1
1797	the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada . 	1
1798	one of [jaglom's] better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love . 	1
1799	the question hanging over the time machine is not , as the main character suggests , 'what if ? ' but rather , 'how can you charge money for this ? '	1
1800	for all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression . 	1
1801	the film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side . 	1
1802	it's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back . 	1
1803	although melodramatic and predictable , this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five filipino-americans and their frantic efforts to find love . 	1
1804	rarely , a movie is more than a movie . go . 	1
1805	although tender and touching , the movie would have benefited from a little more dramatic tension and some more editing . 	1
1806	the performances are so leaden , michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud . 	1
1807	exactly what you'd expect from a guy named kaos . 	1
1808	the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 	1
1809	the off-center humor is a constant , and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery . 	1
1810	a moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide . 	1
1811	directing with a sure and measured hand , [haneke] steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology . 	1
1812	if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash . 	1
1813	the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered . 	1
1814	a pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole . 	1
1815	the trials of henry kissinger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking ï¿½ because you get it . 	1
1816	steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it's so clever you want to hate it . but he somehow pulls it off . 	1
1817	impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie doesn't quite fly . for starters , the story is just too slim . 	1
1818	it's not hateful . it's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical . 	1
1819	this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it . 	1
1820	who , exactly , is fighting whom here ? ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze . 	1
1821	the movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end . 	1
1822	by taking entertainment tonight subject matter and giving it humor and poignancy , auto focus becomes both gut-bustingly funny and crushingly depressing . 	1
1823	hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock's imaginative flight to shyamalan's self-important summer fluff . 	1
1824	twohy is not only skilled at building and maintaining suspense , he's also aware that a cast chock full of experienced character actors is the right fit for a haunted sub flick . 	1
1825	it understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking . 	1
1826	the mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs . 	1
1827	if you're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver's license , you should be able to find better entertainment . 	1
1828	good performances and a realistic , non-exploitive approach make paid in full worth seeing . 	1
1829	using his audience as a figurative port-of-call , dong pulls his even-handed ideological ship to their dock for unloading , before he continues his longer journey still ahead . 	1
1830	ratliff speaks the truth about these pentecostal extremists with fairness and compassion , while the well-intentioned churchgoers shout only semi-truths in a frightfully un-christlike fashion . 	1

1835	an extremely funny , ultimately heartbreaking look at life in contemporary china . 	1
1836	perhaps it's cliche to call the film 'refreshing , ' but it is . 'drumline' shows a level of young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated . 	1
1837	it's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast . 	1
1838	a brutally honest documentary about a much anticipated family reunion that goes wrong thanks to culture shock and a refusal to empathize with others . 	1
1839	director lee has a true cinematic knack , but it's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve . 	1

1841	allen's underestimated charm delivers more goodies than lumps of coal . 	1
1842	being a sayles film , this has a way of looking at things with more patience and maturity than a plot summary might lead us to expect . 	1
1843	for the first time in years , de niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars . 	1
1844	ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 	1
1845	moore's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that's still very much playing itself out . 	1
1846	possibly not since grumpy old men have i heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another . 	1
1847	very annie-mary is familiar but winningly funny and good-hearted . 	1
1848	a recent favourite at sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard's pyromania . 	1
1849	as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure . 	1
1850	the first tunisian film i have ever seen , and it's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment i'm likely to see all year . 	1
1851	aimed at a new age audience , but its subject's sincerity and gentle , self-deprecating nature translate well to a general audience . 	1
1852	purely propaganda , a work of unabashed hero worship , it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that u . s . foreign policy has played in the rise of castro . 	1
1853	a deftly entertaining film , smartly played and smartly directed . 	1
1854	this remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise : al pacino loathing robin williams . 	1
1855	they're just a couple of cops in copmovieland , these two , but in narc , they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood . 	1
1856	it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 	1
1857	a little objectivity could have gone a long way . 	1
1858	 it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes . 	1
1859	a bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing . 	1
1860	miyazaki is one of world cinema's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers . 	1
1861	behan himself knew how to spin a tale and one can't help but think he'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art . 	1
