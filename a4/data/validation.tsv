1474	a deft script by mike white . . . elevates the usual teen twaddle by grounding the laughs in feeling . 	1
1475	ï¿½a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason . 	1
1476	a fine , rousing , g-rated family film , aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats . 	1
1477	provides a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views . 	1
1478	it's a good thing that woolly mammoths are extinct , because this movie will have every kid in the schoolyard wishing for their very own . 	1
1479	too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 	1
1480	though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 	1
1481	s1m0ne's satire is not subtle , but it is effective . it's a quirky , off-beat project . . . . 	1
1482	both flawed and delayed , martin scorcese's gangs of new york still emerges as his most vital work since goodfellas . 	1
1483	a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [besson's] earlier work . 	1
1484	as a director , mr . ratliff wisely rejects the temptation to make fun of his subjects . 	1
1485	the fact that the rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays . 	1
1486	dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter . 	1
1487	this is dicaprio's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year . 	1
1488	perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about . 	1
1489	this is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men . 	1
1490	several of steven soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante . 	1
1491	buy is an accomplished actress , and this is a big , juicy role . 	1
1492	a haunting , rich film . . . [fraser] and caine blend beautifully with their sweet-and-sour mix of acting . 	1
1493	the story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it's as if it all happened only yesterday . 	1
1494	in a time when , more often than not , sequels disappoint , it's refreshing to uncover something this high-profile that fulfils the promise of its name and adds another title to a storied legacy . 	1
1495	has an impact that transcends politics and some dramatic overreaching by writer-director randall wallace . 	1
1496	the only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie . 	1
1497	it's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn . nothing overly original , mind you , but solidly entertaining . 	1
1498	""" """" maid in manhattan """" is a charmer , a pc """" pretty woman """" that ditches the odious prostitution theme for class commentary"""	1
1499	despite its shortcomings , girls can't swim represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch , and it's a worthy entry in the french coming-of-age genre . 	1

1501	what better message than 'love thyself' could young women of any size receive ? 	1
1502	only an epic documentary could get it all down , and spike lee's jim brown : all american at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents . 	1
1503	one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea . 	1
1504	the lively appeal of the last kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy . 	1
1505	the film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma , but what makes it transporting is that it's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years . 	1
1506	it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 	1
1507	a directorial tour de force by bernard rose , ivans xtc . is one of this year's very best pictures . 	1
1508	[a] smarter and much funnier version of the old police academy flicks . 	1
1509	a sloppy , amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise . 	1
1510	about a boy will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it . 	1
1511	anchored by a terrific performance by abbass , satin rouge shows that the idea of women's self-actualization knows few continental divides . 	1
1512	a tour de force drama about the astonishingly pivotal role of imagination in the soulful development of two rowdy teenagers . 	1
1513	it's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer's most pleasurable movies . 	1
1514	sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it . 	1
1515	goes some way towards explaining how the tragedy occurred and its enduring legacy today . 	1
1516	a film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers . 	1
1517	this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable . 	1
1518	proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books , they can't go wrong . better effects , better acting and a hilarious kenneth branagh . an excellent sequel . 	1

1520	"""with a """" spy kids """" sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a """" snl """" has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? """	1
1521	the movie has lots of dancing and fabulous music . there are slow and repetitive parts , but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting . 	1
1522	the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable . 	1
1523	viewed on its own terms , treasure planet is better-than-average family entertainment , but true fans of the stevenson's novel will likely prefer disney's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic . 	1
1524	smith's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes . 	1
1525	provides the kind of 'laugh therapy' i need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending . after seeing 'analyze that , ' i feel better already . 	1
1526	a kinetic drama that seems to wander aimlessly , beautifully until it crashes in an odd anti-climax befitting reality itself . 	1
1527	the overall effect is awe and affection -- and a strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude . 	1
1528	it's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic . 	1
1529	it is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . 	1
1530	perhaps the most remarkable aspect of murderous maids is how restrained and sensitive french director jean-pierre denis keeps his film . 	1
1531	death to smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly -as-nasty -as-it- thinks-it-is joke . over and over again . 	1
1532	time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable . 	1
1533	the plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution . 	1
1534	a sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume drama set in renaissance spain , and the fact that it's based on true events somehow makes it all the more compelling . 	1
1535	more concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , soderbergh's solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem . 	1
1536	hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud . 	1
1537	the importance of being earnest resonates and inspires rapid-fire bouts of laughter , perhaps even a few giggles from the author himself , whom posterity has rewarded the last laugh . 	1
1538	"""it may not be """" last tango in paris """" but . . . """	1
1539	godard has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence . 	1
1540	i have to admit i walked out of runteldat . i did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes . 	1
1541	queen of the damned is too long with too little going on . 	1
1542	every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them . 	1
1543	a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been . 	1
1544	city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . 	1
1545	when so many hollywood films actively discourage higher brain functions , you have to give changing lanes credit for giving you food for thought . 	1
1546	still rapturous after all these years , cinema paradiso stands as one of the great films about movie love . 	1
1547	everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television . 	1
1548	this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 	1
1549	while not all transitions to adulthood are so fraught , there's much truth and no small amount of poetry in girls can't swim . 	1
1550	the story is so light and sugary that were it a macy's thanksgiving day parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away . 	1
1551	most of the things that made the original men in black such a pleasure are still there . 	1
1552	the movie is a meditation on the love and envy that russia has always felt toward europe , and i won't pretend i got more than 30 percent of what was going on . 	1
1553	dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . 	1
1554	the end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump . 	1
1555	watching haneke's film is , aptly enough , a challenge and a punishment . but watching huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting . 	1
1556	let's issue a moratorium , effective immediately , on treacly films about inspirational prep-school professors and the children they so heartwarmingly motivate . 	1
1557	[denis'] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product . 	1
1558	it has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out . 	1
1559	nothing can detract from the affection of that moral favorite : friends will be friends through thick and thin . 	1
1560	if you dig on david mamet's mind tricks . . . rent this movie and enjoy ! 	1
1561	we're not talking a disney treasure here , but if treasure planet falls short of gem status , it should provide youngsters with a reasonable amount of diversion . 	1
1562	an empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance . 	1
1563	this is a heartfelt mea culpa -- which gives paid in full much of its unexpected emotional power . 	1
1564	imamura has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women . it may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made . 	1
1565	the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy . 	1
1566	soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film . what's left is a rich stew of longing . 	1
1567	it's the extra layer that makes this one , the movie's understanding of how disillusion and inner compromise can gradually separate a young artist from his divine spark . 	1
1568	while sunshine state lacks the searing urgency of city of hope or the gentle dï¿½nouement of lone star , fans of the auteur should enjoy this classic john sayles feature . 	1
1569	the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed . 	1
1570	despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs . 	1
1571	why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ? 	1
1572	the most brilliant work in this genre since the 1984 uncut version of sergio leone's flawed but staggering once upon a time in america . 	1
1573	miyazaki's nonstop images are so stunning , and his imagination so vivid , that the only possible complaint you could have about spirited away is that there is no rest period , no timeout . 	1
1574	ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance	1
1575	the movie provides an intimate glimpse of how sensibilities as compatible as oil and water forced themselves to blend and create a successful work despite their aesthetic differences . 	1
1576	a chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags . 	1
1577	there's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to . 	1
1578	newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept ï¿½ a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman . 	1
1579	an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow . 	1
1580	a documentary to make the stones weep -- as shameful as it is scary . 	1
1581	despite the film's bizarre developments , hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity . 	1
1582	holy mad maniac in a mask , splat-man ! good old-fashioned slash-and-hack is back ! 	1
1583	despite these annoyances , the capable clayburgh and tambor really do a great job of anchoring the characters in the emotional realities of middle age . 	1
1584	while insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , nolan's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends ( it ) stimulating depth . 	1
1585	it's a glorious spectacle like those d . w . griffith made in the early days of silent film . 	1
1586	if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta . 	1
1587	the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are . 	1
1588	two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending . 	1
1589	the result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor . 	1
1590	there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy . 	1
1591	this is , not to put too fine a point on it , a swashbuckler , a costume drama . if you love that old story form , you will be in old-fogy heaven , as it is nearly a perfect example of a genre that died out years ago . 	1
1592	hatosy establishes himself here not only as the bona fide star of this little ensemble film , but also as a talent to be watched . 	1
1593	 . . . a good film that must have baffled the folks in the marketing department . 	1
1594	flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . 	1
1595	one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way . 	1
1596	a charming , quirky and leisurely paced scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from monty python's meaning of life . 	1
1597	claude miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications . 	1
1598	the only entertainment you'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles ï¿½ several of them . 	1
1599	while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise . 	1
